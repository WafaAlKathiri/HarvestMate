# HarvestMate

Robotics and Artificial intelligence are becoming substantial tools in shaping the future of agriculture and addressing its challenges. Empowering small-scale agriculture, this project tackles the inefficiency and wastage in fruit harvesting for small-scale growers. They lack expertise, time, and rely on manual methods, resulting in suboptimal harvests, significant agricultural waste, and huge profit loss. Existing solutions designed for large farms are costly and inaccessible to smaller growers. HarvestMate bridges the gap between manual methods and large-scale solutions by providing accessible technology that is user-friendly and costeffective. The project integrates a robotic arm with machine learning models that detect and classify fruit ripeness using colored images. A camera captures fruit data, and the deep learning models determine the fruit type and its ripeness. The robotic arm picks and sorts fruits into designated areas for ripe and rotten fruits. The projectâ€™s performance measures include increased fruit yield, reduced post-harvest losses, and improved profitability for small-scale growers, contributing to a more sustainable and efficient agricultural sector.
